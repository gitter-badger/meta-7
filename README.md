<!-- Draft your README file.

Use the information you gathered in the Open Canvas exercise as a starting point. Be sure to:

Say hello! Welcome people to the project. It’s great to introduce yourself here, so people know they’re dealing with a person or group of real people. Let potential contributors know you’re excited that they’re here to learn more
Write a project description: what you’re doing, with who, for who, and why. Sound familiar? This is a version of your project vision. Expand your sentence as a full paragraph, adding any new details about aims and the problems you plan to solve that surfaced in the Open Canvas activity. Try to phrase this so it’s understandable and appealing to a wide variety of people, not just those in your field.
Explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting! You can use the ideas you generated for “Unique Value Proposition” in your Open Canvas here.
Show how to get started using or contributing to the project. If you’re just getting started, this could be as simple as asking people to attend a planning call or kick-off event, or sign up for an email newsletter about the project. If you’re not sure quite how to get users involved just yet, don’t worry! In the next module, you’ll devise some ways for newcomers to get involved, and create contributor guidelines. Once you’ve done the next module, and you can come back to this README and add a link to contributor guidelines to this section.
State what resources are most needed. If you have a need for a special kind of help, expertise, or a resource like event space, be sure to mention that here.
Test your README for Jargon

When you’re working in any field, whether it’s software engineering or K-12 education, you’ll learn and use jargon – terms that have a special meaning to your field but likely won’t make sense to anyone who isn’t part of that field. Relying too heavily on jargon can not only confuse newcomers, but it can also obscure detail and prevent even those in the know from coming to a shared understanding of terms.

As an experiment, copy and paste your project description (what you’re doing, for who, and why, as described in the second bullet point above) and drop it into the Up-Goer 5 text editor. This text editor limits you to only the “ten hundred” most common words in the English language (so-called because “thousand” isn’t one of those common words). See if you can rewrite the description using only allowed words– it’s often harder than it looks. For reference, here is an example of a rocket ship diagram communicated in common language. This specialized text editor is a great way to identify technical language or any other wording that may confuse newcomers. It’s also a good way for you to clarify your understanding of the terms you use. In your final text, you don’t need to restrict yourself to only the most common words, as in the previous step–if you do, your project description may become overly simplified and limited. But you should use what you’ve learned in step 2 to keep your README as understandable and jargon-free as possible.

Re-write your README

Re-write your entire README in clear language and define all terms. If you use jargon, be sure to define those words as clearly as you can, as part of the README text.

In the next module, you’ll create a Roadmap for your project, a way for you and any potential contributors to keep track of project work that’s upcoming and underway. -->

# Liberate Science

Welcome! This project aims to ensure public access to the public domain, for everyone and for any purpose. In short: reenvision how we consume information by making knowledge a resource instead of a commodity. There are many projects to do, but we are currently working primarily on our [Liberator](https://github.com/libscie/liberator). This repo is our "State Of The Union" (SOTU) of what Liberate Science does.

This is a project that aims to make information freely available for anyone whose interested, so if you are interested and have ideas, let us know (or maybe even [contribute](#contributor-guidelines))

## Project descriptions

### [Liberator](https://github.com/libscie/liberator)

Public access to the public domain is crucial, but not a given. A public park is public domain, but it can be subject to access restrictions (for example, not after dark). With information, it makes no sense to us that access needs to be restricted, because copying costs virtually nothing and has much potential. 

So why is this a problem? Example: this [research paper from 1871](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-006821-3.50008-8) can be freely available and reused, but isn't. Why? Because no one has made it available. This is just one of the 595,735 that are easy to identify as public domain of which public access isn't sure.

That is where this project comes in. There are three steps: 

1. identify what can be liberated

2. get access to those

3. deposit them and start spreading

The end-goal of this project is a website where the user gets prompted to upload an article that can be liberated, if they have access (or can get access). All it requires is a quick download from the publisher, and upload to the website --- Liberator takes care of the rest. A visual representation of the pipeline will be added shortly.

## Contributor guidelines

Looking to contribute? Great! We work on a Pull Request basis, but if you're unfamiliar with Github and spotted a mistake, please feel free to [e-mail](mailto:info@libscie.org) your contribution. Being familiar with Github is not a prerequisite to contribute (if you want to learn go [here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)).

Typical contributions that are appreciated:

1. code reviews
	* we all make mistakes, and so do we. Notice a mistake, no matter how small? Suggest a change.
2. ideas
	* we don't pretend to know all the answers, we just try to work towards them. See us go in a wrong direction? Stop us by providing us with your constructive insight. Submit a Github issue on the relevant project, or [e-mail us](mailto:info@libscie.org).
3. text translation
	* we prefer to have text available to everyone in their native language, because this makes it much easier to understand the content. Any contributions for translations are greatly appreciated, but are limited to Pull Requests initially due to the amount of work. 
	* but if you don't feel confident about translating and would prefer us to provide our content in your language, [e-mail us](mailto:info@libscie.org) and we'll keep a vote count. Each time a language gets 100 votes and we cannot find a contributor to translate, we'll actually hire an official translator. A digital vote count check might be something we make sooner rather than later.
	* we commit to maintaining up-to-date translations for new pages once a translation for a project has been added.
