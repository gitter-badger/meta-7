# Roadmap

## Project Mission & Summary
<!-- Write your “Project Mission & Summary.” Start with the project name along with a shorted version of your project description from the readme, or you can use your vision statement. Since this is key information that all contributors need to understand, it’s okay for some it to be repeated in different places, in different documents. -->

## Milestones
<!-- Pick 1-3 milestones. Depending on your project, milestones can vary: they may be related to software development goals, learning resources you’ll create, events or meetings you plan to hold, campaigns you’ll run. -->
<!-- List tasks to complete for each milestone. Write a short description of each task required to successfully complete project work on a milestone. Depending on your project, these might be items like: “Research existing Javascript learning resources for kids” or “Publicize the October Online Privacy Meet-up” or “Implement a new visualization scheme for the user-facing badges.” Be sure to time here to explain why you are doing this task. This will reinforce your vision for the project and help others see why each step is meaningful in the larger timeline. -->

## Contributor guidelines
<!-- Let people know how they can get involved. As mentioned in the readme section above, this is where you’ll link to contributor guidelines. -->

<!-- Post your Roadmap. You’ll want to put your roadmap online where your potential contributors can find it, and let people know it’s there. If you already have a project website or a repository on a web-based collaboration tool like GitHub, these are excellent places to post your Roadmap. If you don’t have an online presence yet, don’t worry! We’ll cover GitHub in the next section! -->

<!-- Update often! The direction of your project will change as the work evolves. Return to your roadmap frequently to update, add or change milestones, and track your progress! You may want to welcome supporters or key participants into any conversation about Roadmapping, as a way of increasing their participation and sense of ownership of the project.
